# Exploiting Mispricing in the Housing Market Using Data Science
In this data science project we will analyze historic house pricing data and identify buying opportunities. The notebook is organized in 6 sections:

The Dataset: Basic discussion of the dataset that is analyzed
Price Development: Discussion of the development of house prices over the last 20 years
Mispricing: Analysis of areas where houses appear to be most mispriced
Where to Buy a House: Identification of of cities where mispricing allows for good buying opportunities
Mispricing means that an asset (can refer to property as well as to other assets and financial instrumets) is not priced to match its intrinsic value. This means that the price identification process of the market is not working effectively.

The analysis shows that statistically there is a lot of mispricing in the housing market. Especially we can see that different house types rank differently in price in different cities. Besides that, different houst type prices have also increased differently
